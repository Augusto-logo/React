# React Concepts Summary

This document serves as a central index of all React concepts applied across the projects and components in this workspace. It is automatically updated by the agent based on each project's `readme.md` and the rules in the `config/` directory.

## ✨ Core Concepts

### ➤ Lifting State Up

_Keeping shared state at the nearest common ancestor to synchronize child components._

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](pages/Tic-Tac-Toe/readme.md)

### ➤ Immutability

_Avoiding direct state mutation by creating copies, which is crucial for history and performance._

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](pages/Tic-Tac-Toe/readme.md)

### ➤ State Management (`useState`)

_Managing component-level state using React hooks._

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](pages/Tic-Tac-Toe/readme.md)

### ➤ Dynamic UI Generation

_Generating UI elements from data structures (arrays/objects) instead of hardcoding._

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](pages/Tic-Tac-Toe/readme.md)

### ➤ Derived State

_Computing state values from existing state/props rather than duplicating state._

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](pages/Tic-Tac-Toe/readme.md)

### ➤ Conditional Rendering

_Rendering different UI based on application state (e.g., winner, next player)._

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](pages/Tic-Tac-Toe/readme.md)

_(...new concepts will be added here automatically as other projects are documented)_
